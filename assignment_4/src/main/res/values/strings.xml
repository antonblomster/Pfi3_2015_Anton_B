    <string-array name="planet_description">
    <item name="mercury_info">Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days.
                                Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days, which is much faster than any other planet in the Solar System.
                                It has no known natural satellites. The planet is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.</item>


    <item name="venus_info">Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.
                              It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
                              After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows.
                              Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8\°.</item>

    <item name="earth_info">Earth, also called the world and, less frequently, Gaia (and Terra in some works of science fiction) is the third planet from the Sun,
                              the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System\'s four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life.
                              The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earth\'s biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions.
                              Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on the planet are extinct, Earth is currently home to 10–14 million species of life, including over 7.3 billion humans who depend upon its biosphere and minerals.
                              Earth\'s human population is divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.</item>

    <item name="mars_info">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury.
                             Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
                             Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
                             The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons.
                             Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.
                             The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped.
                             These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.</item>

    <item name="jupiter_info">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System.
                                It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun, but is two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
                                Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn (Uranus and Neptune are ice giants). Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.
                                When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
                                (Mars can briefly match Jupiter\'s brightness at certain points in its orbit.)</item>

    <item name="saturn_info">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.
                               Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive.
                               Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god\'s sickle.</item>

    <item name="uranus_info">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
                               Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.
                               Therefore, astronomers increasingly place them in a separate category called \"ice giants\".
                               Uranus\'s atmosphere, although similar to Jupiter\'s and Saturn\'s in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, contains more \"ices\", such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. </item>

    <item name="neptune_info">Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass.
                              Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth, and not as dense as Neptune.
                              Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units. Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune\'s trident.</item>
